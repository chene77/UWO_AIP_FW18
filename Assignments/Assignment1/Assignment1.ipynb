    "The lumbar vertebrae, numbered L1 to L5, are arguably the most geometrically complex bones inside a human body. Each vertebra is composed of the following 3 functional parts:\n",
    "* the vertebral body, designed to bear weight\n",
    "* the vertebral arch, designed to protect the neural elements\n",
    "* the bony processes (spinous and transverse), which increase the efficiency of muscle action.\n",
    "\n",
    "refer to the following picture (taken from [Ultrasonography of the Adult Thoracic and Lumbar Spine for Central Neuraxial Blockage](http://anesthesiology.pubs.asahq.org/article.aspx?articleid=1933770) by Chin et al.):\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Many spinal interventions such as [spinal fusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_fusion) require surgical planning to be performed in 3D, which is often facilitated by generating a 3D surface model of the vertebrae through segmentation.\n",
    " \n",
    "As bone is dense relative to its surrounding soft tissues, x-ray CT is often the choice of imaging modality for spinal interventions. To simplify your task, a vertebra phantom was constructed and imaged using the following processes:\n",
    "* a single L2 vertebra was manufactured using 3D printing process\n",
    "  * the geometry of the vertebra was based on real human data\n",
    "  * this vertebra phantom was printed **in whole** using only hard plastic, which is a dense (high density) material\n",
    "  * this vertebra was scanned using a CT scanner by itself, with nothing but air surrounding it\n",
    "  \n",
    "Often, an object such as this L2 vertebra that simulates certain aspects of human anatomy is called a **phantom**. Because a phantom is designed and manufactured in a controlled manner, some of its properties can be know precisely, providing the ground truth (i.e. gold standard) for research.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, the spinal phantom allows us to learn about segmentation without worry about other structures such as soft tissues surrounding the vertebra.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objective of this assignment is to segment this [osseous](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/osseous) structure from CT using a thresholding mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4>Secondary Objective</h4>\n",
    "Modern scientific endeavors increasingly require team collaboration to construct and interpret complex computational workflows. Jupyter Notebook web application provides an interactive environment for well-documentd and reproducible workflows. Refer to the paper [SimpleITK Image-Analysis Notebooks: a Collaborative Environment for Education and Reproducible Research](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10278-017-0037-8) by Ziv et al. for why SimpleITK Jupyter Notebooks is particular fitting for Image Processing and Analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment must be completed as a Jupyter Notebook document (`.ipynb` file). In addition to present your Python codes to achieve the Primary Objective above, you need to presented your work that is properly documented."
