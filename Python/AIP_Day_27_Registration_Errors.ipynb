    "\n",
    "When we perform registration, our goal is to minimize the Target Registration Error. In practice it needs to be below a problem specific threshold for the registration to be useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "The target point(s) can be a single point or a region in space, and we want to minimize our registration error for this target. We go about this task by minimizing another quantity, in paired-point registration this is the FRE, in the case of intensity based registration we minimize an appropriate similarity metric. In both cases we expect that TRE is minimized indirectly.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can easily lead us astray, down the path of **overfitting**. In our 2D case, instead of using a rigid transformation with **three degrees of freedom** we may be tempted to use an affine transformation with **six degrees of freedom**. By introducing these additional degrees of freedom we will likely improve the FRE, but what about TRE?   \n",
    "\n",
    "In the cell below  you can qualitatively evaluate the effects of overfitting. Start by adding noise with no rotation or translation and then register. Switch to an affine transformation model and see how registration effects the fiducials and targets. You can then repeat this qualitative evaluation incorporating translation/rotation and noise. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we are working in an ideal setting, we know the appropriate transformation model is rigid. Unfortunately, this is often not the case. So which transformation model should you use? When presented with multiple competing hypotheses we select one using the principle of parsimony, often referred to as [Occam's razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor). Our choice is to select the simplest model that can explain our observations. \n",
    "\n",
    "**In the case of registration, the transformation model with the least degrees of freedom that reduces the TRE below the problem specific threshold.**"
