The condition may also be a string or list value, in fact any sequence; anything with a non-zero length is true, empty sequences are false. The test used in the example is a simple comparison. The standard comparison operators are written the same as in C: `<` (less than), `>` (greater than), `==` (equal to), `<=` (less than or equal to), `>=` (greater than or equal to) and `!=` (not equal to).\n",

In practice you will prepare more complicated input for Python with a text editor; all decent text editors have an auto-indent facility. When a compound statement is entered interactively, it must be followed by a <b>blank line</b> to indicate completion (since the parser cannot guess when you have typed the last line). Note that each line within a basic block must be indented by the same amount.\n",

    "If you quit from the Python interpreter and enter it again, the definitions you have made (functions and variables) are lost. Therefore, if you want to write a somewhat longer program, you are better off using a text editor to prepare the input for the interpreter and running it with that file as input instead. This is known as creating a <b>script</b>. As your program gets longer, you may want to split it into several files for easier maintenance. You may also want to use a handy function that you’ve written in several programs without copying its definition into each program.\n",
    "\n",
    "To support this, Python has a way to put definitions in a file and use them in a script or in an interactive instance of the interpreter. Such a file is called a <b>module</b>; definitions from a module can be imported into other modules or into the main module (the collection of variables that you have access to in a script executed at the top level and in calculator mode).\n",
    "\n",
    "A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. The file name is the module name with the suffix `.py` appended. Within a module, the module’s name (as a string) is available as the value of the global variable `__name__`.

    "### Python scopes and namespaces\n",

    "\n",
    "Let’s begin with some definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "A <b>namespace</b> is a mapping from names to objects. Most namespaces are currently implemented as Python dictionaries, but that’s normally not noticeable in any way (except for performance), and it may change in the future. Examples of namespaces are: the set of built-in names (containing functions such as abs(), and built-in exception names); the global names in a module; and the local names in a function invocation. In a sense the set of attributes of an object also form a namespace. <b>The important thing to know about namespaces is that there is absolutely no relation between names in different namespaces</b>; for instance, two different modules may both define a function maximize without confusion — users of the modules must prefix it with the module name.\n",
    "\n",
    "An <b>attribute</b> is any word following a dot -- for example, in the expression `my.height`, `height` is an attribute of the object `my`. Attributes may be read-only or writable. In the latter case, assignment to attributes is possible. Module attributes are writable: you can write `modname.the_answer = 42`. Writable attributes may also be deleted with the `del` statement. For example, `del modname.the_answer` will remove the attribute `the_answer` from the object named by `modname`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Namespaces are created at different moments and have different lifetimes:\n",
    "* The namespace containing the built-in names is created when the Python interpreter starts up, and is never deleted. \n",
    "* The global namespace for a module is created when the module definition is read in; normally, module namespaces also last until the interpreter quits. \n",
    "* The statements executed by the top-level invocation of the interpreter, either read from a script file or interactively, are considered part of a module called `__main__`, so they have their own global namespace. (The built-in names actually also live in a module; this is called `__builtin__`.)\n",
    "* The local namespace for a function is created when the function is called, and deleted when the function returns or raises an exception that is not handled within the function. (Actually, forgetting would be a better way to describe what actually happens.) Of course, <b>recursive invocations</b> each have their own local namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "A <b>scope</b> is a textual region of a Python program where a namespace is directly accessible. “Directly accessible” here means that an unqualified reference to a name attempts to find the name in the namespace. Although scopes are determined statically, they are used dynamically. At any time during execution, there are at least three nested scopes whose namespaces are directly accessible:\n",
    "* the innermost scope, which is searched first, contains the local names \n",
    "* the scopes of any enclosing functions, which are searched starting with the nearest enclosing scope, contains non-local, but also non-global names\n",
    "* the next-to-last scope contains the current module’s global names\n",
    "* the outermost scope (searched last) is the namespace containing built-in names\n",
    "\n",
    "If a name is declared global, then all references and assignments go directly to the middle scope containing the module’s global names. Otherwise, all variables found outside of the innermost scope are read-only (an attempt to write to such a variable will simply create a new local variable in the innermost scope, leaving the identically named outer variable unchanged)."
