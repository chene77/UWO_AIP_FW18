    "Another type of deformable, point-based, registration is B-splines deformation. It was initially introduced as a way to interpolate scattered data. It is actually not often used to register image itself, but rather, just deforms and image and provide a way to interpolate the pixels between control points. Later, it is incorporated into an *intensity* based image registration by using grid/lattice as control points.\n",
