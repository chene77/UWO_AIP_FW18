    "At the end of Day 7 lecture (Region growing segmentation), we experimented with the concept of morphological operation to **clean up** the segmentation results.  Often, using histogram-based segmentation techniques, we are left with *holes* and other unwanted image artifacts in the segmented image. One possible reason for these artifacts to exist in segmentation is due to image noise: these holes correspond to pixel with intensity that falls outsize of the *normal* range (as compared to its surrounding neighbours). Thus techniques relying on thresholding or some statistical measures of the neighbouring pixel intensity won't be able to classify properly.\n",
